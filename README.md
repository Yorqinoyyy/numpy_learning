# NumPy Learning Journey - Day 1 🚀  

Today I started learning NumPy, a powerful library for numerical computing in Python.  
This day focused on basics: creating arrays, understanding their attributes, slicing, reshaping, and simple operations.  

---

## 📚 Topics Covered:
- Creating arrays using np.array(), np.arange(), and np.linspace()
- Array attributes: shape, size, dtype
- Special arrays: zeros, ones, eye, full, empty
- Random arrays: np.random.rand, np.random.randint
- Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Indexing & slicing
- Reshaping arrays
- Boolean indexing
- Aggregate functions: sum, mean, max, min
- Broadcasting
- Copying arrays

## 🗓️ Daily Learning Log:
- Day 1: Practiced creating arrays, slicing, reshaping, and applying simple operations.

Next: Day 2 → Mathematical functions & more advanced operations!

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy
