# ðŸ“˜ NumPy Learning Journey ðŸš€

This repository contains my practical exercises and examples while learning NumPy.  
The examples are organized from simple to more advanced concepts.

## ðŸ“š Previously Learned:
- Importing the NumPy library (import numpy as np)
- Creating basic arrays
- Checking array data types (.dtype)
- Selecting array elements (indexing and slicing)
- Checking .shape and reshaping arrays (.reshape)
- Basic mathematical operations on arrays

## âœ… Learned Today (Day 3):
- Practiced indexing and slicing on 1D and 2D arrays  
- Used boolean indexing for conditional selection of elements  
- Applied fancy indexing with arrays of indices  
- Combined multiple conditions using logical operators  
- Manipulated array shapes using .reshape(), .ravel(), and .flatten()  
- Explored array attributes: .ndim, .size, .item()  

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy

ðŸ’¡ I am actively building my NumPy skills step by step.  
Stay tuned for more daily progress!
