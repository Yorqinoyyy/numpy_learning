# ðŸ“Š NumPy Learning Journey ðŸš€  

This repository contains my practical exercises and examples while learning NumPy.  
The examples are organized from simple to more advanced concepts.  

## ðŸ“š Previously Learned:
- Importing the NumPy library (import numpy as np)  
- Creating basic arrays  
- Checking array data types (.dtype)  
- Selecting array elements (indexing and slicing)  
- Checking (.shape) and reshaping arrays (.reshape)  

## ðŸ“… Learned Today:
- Boolean indexing (conditional selection)  
- Mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division  
- Statistical functions: np.max, np.min, np.mean  
- Working with conditions on arrays  

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries:
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  

## âœ¨ Purpose:
To strengthen my understanding of NumPy for efficient data processing and build a solid foundation for Data Science.
