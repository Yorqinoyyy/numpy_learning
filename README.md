# NumPy Learning Repository

Welcome to my NumPy learning journey! 🚀  
This repository contains my learning notes, code examples, and mini-projects as I study the powerful Python library: NumPy.

## 📚 About NumPy

NumPy (Numerical Python) is the core library for scientific computing in Python.  
It provides:

- Fast and memory-efficient array objects
- Powerful tools for mathematical operations
- Easy integration with data science and machine learning workflows

## ✍️ What You'll Find in This Repository

This repo contains structured learning resources and code as I study the following core topics:

### 🧱 Basics of NumPy Arrays
- Creating 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays
- Array indexing and slicing
- Array data types and shape manipulation

### 🧮 Array Operations
- Element-wise arithmetic operations
- Broadcasting and vectorization
- Aggregation functions: sum(), mean(), std(), etc.

### 🔄 Reshaping and Combining Arrays
- reshape(), flatten(), ravel()
- Stacking (vstack, hstack) and splitting arrays

### 🎯 Boolean Indexing and Filtering
- Conditional selection
- Masking and filtering elements

### 📊 Mathematical and Statistical Functions
- Trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic operations
- Descriptive statistics on arrays

### 🧠 Linear Algebra with NumPy
- Matrix multiplication (dot, matmul)
- Inverse, transpose, and determinant
- Solving linear equations: np.linalg.solve

### 🌀 Random Module
- Generating random numbers
- Setting seeds for reproducibility
- Simulating data for experiments

### ⚙️ Performance and Memory Efficiency
- Vectorization vs loops
- Understanding memory layout
- np.where(), np.any(), np.all()
